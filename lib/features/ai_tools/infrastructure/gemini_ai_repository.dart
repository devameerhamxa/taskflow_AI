      4. ADVANCED PRIORITY ALGORITHM:
         
         CRITICAL (Urgent + Important):
         - Health emergencies, safety issues
         - Legal deadlines, tax obligations
         - Work deadlines with consequences
         - Relationship crisis situations
         - Financial emergencies

         HIGH (Important, Time-Sensitive):
         - Work projects with clear deadlines

         - Important relationship events
         - Financial planning and bill payments

         - Optional social activities
         - Wishlist items and future considerations

      5. SOPHISTICATED DUE DATE INTELLIGENCE:
         
         TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS:
         - "right now", "immediately", "asap" â†’ Within 2 hours
         - "today", "this morning/afternoon" â†’ Same day, appropriate time
         - "tomorrow", "next day" â†’ Following day, 9 AM default
         - "this week", "by Friday" â†’ End of current week
         - "next week", "Monday" â†’ Specific day next week
         - "this month", "end of month" â†’ Last day of current month
         - "next month" â†’ 15th of following month
         - "someday", "eventually" â†’ 30 days from now

         CONTEXTUAL TIMING:
         - Work tasks: Business hours (9 AM - 5 PM)
         - Personal calls: Early evening (6 PM - 8 PM)
         - Appointments: Standard business hours
         - Health tasks: Morning preferred (9 AM - 11 AM)

      6. INTELLIGENT TASK TITLE GENERATION:
         
         PRINCIPLES:
         - Start with action verbs: Call, Complete, Schedule, Review, Create, Plan, Research
         - Include essential context: "Call Dr. Smith about test results"
         - Maintain emotional neutrality while preserving intent
         - Keep under 60 characters but pack in meaning
         - Transform negative framing to positive action
         
         EXAMPLES:
         - "I hate my messy room" â†’ "Organize and Clean Bedroom"
         - "I can't keep eating junk food" â†’ "Plan Healthy Meal Options"
         - "I'm terrible at staying in touch" â†’ "Reconnect with Important People"
         - "I never exercise" â†’ "Start Regular Exercise Routine"

      7. CONTEXTUAL TASK ENHANCEMENT:
         - If user mentions a problem, create solution-oriented tasks
         - If user expresses a wish, break it into actionable steps
         - If user shows stress, suggest manageable first steps
         - If user mentions people, consider relationship dynamics
         - If user mentions locations, factor in travel time
         - If user mentions emotions, address the underlying need

      8. FALLBACK INTELLIGENCE:
         - For vague inputs: Create exploratory tasks ("Research options for...")
         - For complex problems: Create planning tasks ("Create action plan for...")
         - For emotional expressions: Create supportive tasks ("Schedule self-care time")
         - For incomplete thoughts: Create clarification tasks ("Define requirements for...")

      RESPONSE FORMAT:
      Return ONLY a valid JSON object with these exact fields (no markdown, no extra text):
      {
        "title": "Smart, action-oriented title that captures intent and context",
        "dueDate": "ISO-8601 date string with intelligent timing",
        "priority": "critical|high|medium|low"
      }

      ENHANCED EXAMPLES:

      Input: "I hate how messy my apartment is and I can't find anything"
      Output: {"title": "Deep Clean and Organize Apartment", "dueDate": "2024-01-20T10:00:00.000Z", "priority": "high"}

      Input: "I've been meaning to call my grandmother but keep forgetting"
      Output: {"title": "Call Grandmother for Catch-Up", "dueDate": "2024-01-16T18:00:00.000Z", "priority": "medium"}

      Input: "My presentation is next Monday and I'm panicking"
      Output: {"title": "Complete Presentation for Monday", "dueDate": "2024-01-21T09:00:00.000Z", "priority": "critical"}

      Input: "I wish I could learn to play guitar someday"
      Output: {"title": "Research Guitar Learning Options", "dueDate": "2024-01-22T19:00:00.000Z", "priority": "low"}
